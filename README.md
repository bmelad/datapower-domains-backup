# Backup your DataPower application domains

Every IBM DataPower Gateway administrator needs to have an up-to-date backup of the system configuration. This script will do that job for you! Just update the relevant information at the bottom line and you're good-to-go.
After your configuration is set - just schedule this script ro run on your required interval.


BTW, do not forget to turn on the SOMA (XML Management Interface) on your appliance if it disabled for any reason.
